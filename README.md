# Employee Attrition Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This repository contains a data analysis project focusing on employee attrition using R. The dataset, sourced from HR records, includes various factors related to employees, and the goal is to identify patterns and insights that can help in understanding and preventing attrition.

## Project Structure

The project is organized with the following files:

- **.gitignore:** This file specifies patterns to be ignored by version control. It ensures that certain files (e.g., temporary files, outputs) are not tracked by Git.

- **README.md:** This file provides essential information about the project, its purpose, and the structure of the repository.

- **dataset.csv:** The dataset file contains information on past and current employees, including factors such as education, satisfaction levels, and performance ratings.

- **decision_tree.ipynb:** This Jupyter Notebook focuses on implementing a decision tree algorithm for predictive modeling based on the dataset.

- **naivebayes.ipynb:** This Jupyter Notebook implements a Naive Bayes algorithm for analyzing the dataset and making predictions related to employee attrition.

- **visualization.ipynb:** This Jupyter Notebook is dedicated to data visualization techniques, allowing for a clearer understanding of trends and patterns in the dataset.

## Data Source and Context

The dataset is a fictional representation of HR records and is designed to help analyze and understand the factors contributing to employee attrition. The context of the project is to leverage the data to provide valuable insights for decision-making within the organization.

## Acknowledgments and Inspiration

The project draws inspiration from a Watson Analytics use case for HR, aiming to retain valuable employees. The dataset and initial motivation for the project are credited to the [IBM Watson Analytics blog](source link).

## Instructions for Running Notebooks

1. Ensure you have R and Jupyter Notebook installed on your system.
2. Open Jupyter Notebook and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the notebooks in the following order: `visualization.ipynb`, `decision_tree.ipynb`, and `naivebayes.ipynb`.
